## Problem Set 6

This problem set uses the Social Media advertiser data gathered by Adam Halper from Whatsgoodly, a social polling company. You can download the data for yourself [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncovering-millennials-shopping-habits-and-socia) This data is centered around Millennial and Generation Z users of social media and how advertisements influence their purchases. Using 50,770 self-reported responses from users of Whatsgoodly, this app hopes to find trends between which social media platforms more effectively advertise to younger generations and which ones fail to effectively entice their users.

# The App

There are three tabs in this Problem Set. The first tab, _About_, displays five random data points from the dataset and describes what each classification means.

The second tab, _Plot_, is an interactive plot where the user can manipulate the 258 recorded demographics in the data and have specific demographics displayed in a bar plot. Responses only covered 5 possible answers: **Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and None**.

The third tab, _Table_, gives an interactive table where the user may see trends in how many total responses in the data are for certain social media platforms. As there are many different demographics of varying sizes within the data, they may manipulate the data by only having values given from "more reliable demographics" counted through adding a minimum demographic size through the slider to the left of the table.
